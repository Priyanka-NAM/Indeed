We have implemented various features present in the original web application like
1) The JobSeeker, Employer cand signup and login to the system.
2) The Employer can post jobs and its details into the application and allowing job seekers to apply for the available jobs.
3) The JobSeeker can search for jobs based on the various factors like location, salary and can apply to them.
4) The JobSeeker can upload his resume and CV to his profile, moreover, a job seeker can also add reviews, comments on Company's page.
5) The Employer can add images of their work location and can also view job seeker's profile, resume and cv.
6) The Employer can update the application status of the Job Application.
7) The Employer can send messages to job seekers who applied to the jobs posted by the employer.
8) The JobSeeker can reply to the messages sent by the employer.
9) The Admin can review the comments posted by the job seekers, and can approve or reject the comments.
